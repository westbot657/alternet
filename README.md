# Betanet Version 1.1 – Official Implementation Specification

> **Normative document.** All requirements marked **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, or **SHALL** are mandatory for compliance.

---

## 0  Status & Scope

Betanet is a fully decentralised, censorship-resistant network intended to replace the public Internet.
This revision finalises covert transport indistinguishability, removes linkability vectors, specifies liveness for naming, hardens governance and bootstrap economics, and standardises adaptive calibration.

---

## 1  General Encoding Rules

* Multi-byte integers: **unsigned big-endian**.
* `varint`: QUIC variable-length integer (RFC 9000 §16).
* Unless stated, sizes are in bytes.
* Binary examples use hexadecimal.

---

## 2  Cryptography

| Purpose             | Primitive                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Hash                | **SHA-256** (32)                                   |
| AEAD                | **ChaCha20-Poly1305** (IETF, 12-B nonce, 16-B tag) |
| KDF                 | **HKDF-SHA256**                                    |
| Signatures          | **Ed25519**                                        |
| Diffie–Hellman      | **X25519**                                         |
| Post-quantum hybrid | **X25519-Kyber768** (hybrid)                       |

**PQ requirement.** From *2027-01-01*, the **inner** key agreement (L2 §5.3) **MUST** be hybrid X25519-Kyber768. The **outer** TLS handshake (L2 §5.1) **MUST** mirror the front origin and **MUST NOT** advertise PQ that diverges from the origin’s canonical fingerprint.

**Algorithm agility.** Implementations **MUST** expose a registry of cryptographic parameters keyed by OIDs; future substitutions **MUST** be negotiated via governance (L7) without changing wire formats where lengths permit.

---

## 3  Layer Model

| Layer  | Function                                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L0** | Access media (any IP bearer: fibre, 5G, sat, LoRa, etc.)    |
| **L1** | Path selection & routing (SCION + HTX-tunnelled transition) |
| **L2** | Cover transport (HTX over TCP-443 / QUIC-443)               |
| **L3** | Overlay mesh (libp2p-v2 object relay)                       |
| **L4** | Optional privacy hop (Nym mixnet)                           |
| **L5** | Naming & trust (self-certifying IDs + 3-chain alias ledger) |
| **L6** | Payments (federated Cashu + Lightning)                      |
| **L7** | Applications                                                |

---

## 4  Path Layer (L1)

### 4.1 SCION Packet Header

```
0       1       2       3
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|Ver=0x2|Reserved|  Type        |
+-------------------------------+
|     Total Header Length       |
+-------------------------------+
|       Payload Length          |
+-------------------------------+
|      Path Segment 0 …         |
+-------------------------------+
```

* **Ver** MUST be `0x02`.
* **Type** MUST be `0x01` (single path) or `0x03` (path list).
* Each AS-hop signature in every segment **MUST** verify before forwarding; otherwise drop.

### 4.2 Transition Across Non-SCION Links (HTX-Tunnelled)

Gateways bridging non-SCION segments **MUST** encapsulate SCION packets inside an **HTX control session** (L2) between gateways:

* Establish an HTX session using §5 (origin-mirrored TLS).
* Negotiate a **Transition Control Stream** opened by the gateway acting as the **server**, with **stream\_id=2** (first even stream).
* The control stream payload is a single CBOR map:

  ```
  { prevAS, nextAS, TS, FLOW, NONCE, SIG }
  ```

  where `TS` = unix-sec, `FLOW` = 8B random, `NONCE` = 8B random, and
  `SIG` = Ed25519 over `(prevAS ‖ nextAS ‖ TS ‖ FLOW ‖ NONCE ‖ "bn-t1")`.
* Gateways **MUST** verify `TS` within **±300 s**, reject duplicate `(FLOW,TS)` for **2 h**, and apply per-peer token buckets.
* SCION payloads are carried on subsequent HTX streams. No per-packet transition header appears on the public wire.
* Gateways **MUST** close and re-establish the control stream on rekey (§5.3). Out-of-date control streams are invalid.

**Public-Internet requirement.** The legacy on-wire transition header is **PROHIBITED** on public networks. It **MAY** be used only on private, administratively controlled links (§11).

### 4.3 Path Maintenance

* Maintain **up to 3** disjoint validated paths per peer.
* Switch within **300 ms** when an alternative validated path exists.
* Probe with exponential back-off (min 1 s, max 60 s); **MUST NOT** exceed 1 probe per destination per **10 s** under persistent loss.

---

## 5  Cover Transport (L2) — HTX

### 5.1 Outer TLS 1.3 Handshake (Origin Mirroring & Auto-Calibration)

* Clients **MUST** mirror the front origin’s fingerprint class (JA3/JA4 family, ALPN set, extension order, GREASE, H2 SETTINGS, H3 availability).
* A **per-connection calibration pre-flight** to the same origin (or same CDN POP if indicated) **MUST** be performed before inner handshake; any deviation **MUST** fail closed.
* **Tolerances:** ALPN **set and order MUST match exactly**. Extension order **MUST match exactly**. H2 SETTINGS values **MUST** be within **±15 %** of calibrated origin values where the origin publishes variable ranges; otherwise **MUST** match exactly.
* **POP selection:** If the origin presents geo/POP variance, clients **MUST** calibrate against the same POP as the target connection as indicated by authoritative DNS co-location or CDN route headers; otherwise calibration **MUST** be repeated until equality is achieved.
* ALPN selection **MUST** match the origin; fixed global distributions are **PROHIBITED**.
* Session resumption **MUST** follow origin policy; **0-RTT MUST NOT** be used for HTX initiation.

### 5.2 Access-Ticket Bootstrap (Negotiated Carrier, Replay-Bound)

1. Decoy site publishes `ticketPub` (X25519, 32B), `ticketKeyID` (8B), and a **carrier policy** describing allowed carriers and probabilities:

   ```
   BN-Ticket: v1; carriers=cookie:0.5,query:0.3,body:0.2; len=24..64
   ```
2. Client generates `cliPriv/cliPub` (X25519) and 32-B `nonce32`.
3. `sharedSecret = X25519(cliPriv, ticketPub)`.
4. `hour = floor(unixTime/3600)` (UTC).
5. `salt = SHA256("betanet-ticket-v1" ‖ ticketKeyID ‖ uint64_be(hour))`.
6. `accessTicket = HKDF(sharedSecret, salt, "", 32)`.
7. Client sends **exactly one** carrier chosen per policy with **variable-length padding** to match `len`:

   * **Cookie (recommended):**
     `Cookie: <site-name>=Base64URL( 0x01 ‖ cliPub32 ‖ ticketKeyID8 ‖ nonce32 ‖ accessTicket32 ‖ pad )`
     A `__Host-` prefix is RECOMMENDED.
   * **Query parameter:** `...?bn1=<Base64URL(payload)>`
   * **Body (POST)** with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` containing `bn1=<Base64URL(payload)>`.
8. Server verification:

   * recompute for `hour ∈ {now-1, now, now+1}`,
   * reject duplicates for tuple `(cliPub, hour)` within **2 h**,
   * enforce per-/24 IPv4 and /56 IPv6 token buckets.
9. Servers **MUST** parse fields in order (`version, cliPub32, ticketKeyID8, nonce32, accessTicket32`) and **MUST ignore trailing bytes** (padding). Accepted padding range is **24..64 bytes**.
10. On duplicate rejection, clients **SHOULD** rotate `cliPub`.
11. On failure, server serves only decoy content.

### 5.3 Noise *XK* Handshake & Inner Keys (with PQ)

* Inner handshake **MUST** be Noise *XK* over the outer TLS tunnel.
* From *2027-01-01*, initiators **MUST** use hybrid (X25519-Kyber768); prior to that, X25519 is RECOMMENDED.
* Derive `K0 = HKDF-Expand-Label(TLS-Exporter, "htx inner v1", "", 64)`.

  * Split per direction: `K0c`, `K0s`.
  * Derive per-direction **nonce salt** `NS = HKDF(K0*, "ns", "", 12)`.
* AEAD Nonce: `nonce = NS XOR (LE64(counter) ‖ LE32(0))`; counter starts at **0** and increments per frame.
* Rekeying (**MUST** meet all):

  * Send `KEY_UPDATE` when any: **≥ 8 GiB**, **≥ 2¹⁶ frames**, or **≥ 1 h** since last (re)key per direction.
  * New keys: `K' = HKDF(K, "next", transcript_hash, 64)`; reset counter; derive `NS'`.
* Ordering: Receivers **MUST** accept `KEY_UPDATE` out-of-order relative to data frames and **MUST** discard frames that verify only under the previous key after receiving and acknowledging `KEY_UPDATE`. Senders **MUST** cease using the old key immediately after transmitting `KEY_UPDATE`.

### 5.4 Inner Frame Format

```c
struct Frame {
  uint24  length;     // ciphertext length (excl. tag)
  uint8   type;       // 0=STREAM, 1=PING, 2=CLOSE, 3=KEY_UPDATE, 4=WINDOW_UPDATE
  varint  stream_id;  // present if type==STREAM or type==WINDOW_UPDATE
  uint8[] ciphertext;
}
```

* Client streams **odd**; server streams **even**.
* Flow-control window: **65 535**; send `WINDOW_UPDATE` when ≥ **50 %** consumed.

### 5.5 HTTP/2 / HTTP/3 Behaviour Emulation (Adaptive)

* H2 SETTINGS **MUST** mirror origin within tolerances learned during pre-flight (§5.1).
* PING cadence **MUST** be random in **\[10 s, 60 s]** with ±10 % jitter; periodicity is **PROHIBITED**.
* PRIORITY frames **SHOULD** follow the origin’s baseline rate; if unknown, send on **\[0.5 %, 3 %]** of connections at random.
* Idle padding: if no DATA for **\[200 ms, 1 200 ms]**, send **\[0, 3 KiB]** dummy encrypted DATA (uniform in both).

### 5.6 UDP Variant & Anti-Correlation Fallback

* Attempt QUIC v1 on UDP-443 with MASQUE `CONNECT-UDP`.
* On failure, retry TCP with randomized back-off **\[200 ms, 1 200 ms]**, **fresh** ClientHello randomness, no session resumption, and fresh QUIC CIDs when applicable.
* To defeat induced linkability, clients **MUST** launch **cover connections** to **≥ 2** unrelated origins (non-HTX) within **\[0, 1 000 ms]** of the retry; HTX start **MUST** be delayed by an additional **\[100, 700 ms]** chosen independently.
* Cover connections **MUST NOT** exceed **2** retries per minute and **MUST** be torn down within **\[3, 15] s** unless they carry user traffic.

---

## 6  Overlay Mesh (L3)

### 6.1 Peer Identity

`PeerID =` multihash `0x12 0x20 || SHA-256(pubkey)`.

### 6.2 Transports

```
/betanet/htx/1.1.0      (TCP-443)
/betanet/htxquic/1.1.0  (QUIC-443)
/betanet/webrtc/1.0.0   (optional)
```

### 6.3 Bootstrap Discovery (Rotating, PoW-Bound)

Clients **MUST** iterate methods **a → e** until **≥ 5** peers respond:

| Order | Method                                                                                      | Central infra? |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| a     | **Rotating Rendezvous DHT**: 64 ephemeral IDs `SHA256("bn-seed" ‖ BeaconSet(epochDay) ‖ i)` | No             |
| b     | **mDNS** service `_betanet._udp`                                                            | No             |
| c     | **Bluetooth LE** UUID `0xB7A7`                                                              | No             |
| d     | Onion v3 list (signed, mirrored via IPFS)                                                   | Minimal        |
| e     | DNS fallback list                                                                           | Yes (fallback) |

* Deterministic seeds from 1.0 are **REMOVED**.
* Responders **MUST** require proof-of-work (initial **≥ 22 bits**, adaptive per §6.5) and rate-limit per source prefix; verification **MUST** be constant-time.
* **Epoch definition:** `epochDay = floor(unixTime/86 400)` in **UTC**.

### 6.4 Block Exchange

* CID = `multihash(SHA-256(content))`.
* Bitswap-v2 on `/betanet/bitswap/2.2.0`.
* Requesters **SHOULD** open **≥ 2** parallel streams on distinct SCION paths and **MAY** open a third under good conditions.

### 6.5 Adaptive Anti-Abuse

* Each bootstrap responder **MUST** maintain sliding-window metrics and adjust PoW difficulty to keep accept rate at the 95th percentile of capacity.
* Rate-limits **MUST** apply per `/24` IPv4, `/56` IPv6, and per-AS aggregates; any bucket **MUST NOT** exceed **5 %** of responder capacity.

---

## 7  Privacy Layer (L4)

### 7.1 Modes

| Mode                   | Requirement                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **strict**             | Every stream through **≥ 3** Nym hops        |
| **balanced** (default) | **≥ 2** hops until peer-trust ≥ **0.8**      |
| **performance**        | No mixnet unless destination label `.mixreq` |

### 7.2 Mixnode Selection (BeaconSet + Per-Stream Entropy)

* `epoch = floor(unixTime/3600)`.
* `BeaconSet(epoch) = XOR32(drand(epoch), nistRBv2(epoch), ethL1_finalized_hash(epoch))`, each a 32-byte value; components **MAY** be substituted by governance.
* If **all** components are unavailable, use fallback
  `BeaconSet(epoch) = SHA256("bn-fallback" ‖ K0c ‖ uint64_be(epoch))` and **MUST** log the condition.
* For each stream, initiator picks 16-B `streamNonce`.
* `seed = SHA256( BeaconSet(epoch) ‖ srcPeerID ‖ dstPeerID ‖ streamNonce )`.
* Hops chosen by VRF over `seed` from the advertised mixnode set.
* **Diversity:** within `(src,dst,epoch)`, avoid reusing the exact hop set until **≥ 8** distinct sets are tried.
* **Topology:** include at least one hop outside both source and destination AS groups.

### 7.3 Peer-Trust (for “balanced”)

Computed from:

* uptime attestations signed by **≥ 8** distinct AS groups over a 30-day window,
* observed relay behaviour,
* staked ecash capped by per-AS limits (L7 §10.2).
  Thresholds are normative; combination is implementation-defined.

---

## 8  Naming & Trust (L5)

### 8.1 Self-Certifying ID

```
betanet://<hex SHA-256(service-pubkey)>[/resource]
```

Verify that the peer’s presented pubkey hashes to the ID.

### 8.2 Human-Readable Alias Ledger (Finality-Bound 2-of-3 with Liveness)

A record is **valid** iff an identical payload hash appears **finalized** on at least **2 of 3** chains, each with native finality:

* **Handshake** L1: **≥ 12** confirmations and not reorged for **≥ 1 h**.
* **Filecoin FVM**: chain reports **finalized**.
* **Ethereum L2 “Raven-Names”**: block marked **finalized** by the rollup.

Record payload (UTF-8):

```
betanet1 pk=<hex32> seq=<u64> sig=<base64sig> exp=<unixSec>
```

* `seq` **MUST** increase monotonically per `pk`.
* Conflicts: higher `seq` wins once finality condition is met.

**Liveness rule.** If fewer than 2 chains provide finality for **≥ 14 days**, nodes **MAY** accept an **Emergency Advance** for a `pk` when all hold:

1. A quorum certificate with **≥ 67 %** of **effective governance weight** (§10.2–§10.3) over the payload hash (`pk,seq,sig,exp`).
2. The certificate is anchored once on any available chain (best-effort).
3. When 2-of-3 finality resumes, the first finalized record at **≥ seq** supersedes emergency records.

**Quorum certificate format (CBOR map).**

```
{ payloadHash, epoch, signers[], weights[], sigs[] }
```

Each `sig` is Ed25519 over `("bn-aa1" ‖ payloadHash ‖ epoch)`. Verifiers **MUST** validate weights per §10.2–§10.3 and reject duplicates or lower-epoch certificates.

---

## 9  Payment System (L6)

### 9.1 Federated Cashu Mints

* Each mint = FROST-Ed25519 **(n ≥ 5, t = 3)** group.
* Keyset ID = `SHA-256(sorted pubkeys)`.
* Mints announce on `betanet.mints` with **≥ 22-bit** PoW and an HTX contact endpoint.

**Voucher (128 B):**

```
keysetID32 ‖ secret32 ‖ aggregatedSig64
```

* `aggregatedSig64` is the 64-B Ed25519 aggregate signature over `secret32`.
* Relays **MUST** accept vouchers only for known keysets; unknown keysets **MAY** be cached pending validation.
* Per-keyset and per-peer rate-limits **MUST** apply.

### 9.2 Settlement

Relays **MAY** redeem ≥ 10 000 sat via their own Lightning node or swap with peers.
Vouchers **MUST NOT** leave encrypted streams.

---

## 10  Governance & Versioning (L7)

### 10.1 Node Uptime Score

```
score = log2(1 + seconds_uptime / 86_400)   // capped at 16
```

### 10.2 Voting Power & Anti-Concentration

```
vote_weight_raw = uptime_score + log10(total_ecash_staked / 1_000 sat + 1)
```

* **Per-AS cap:** the **sum** of `vote_weight_raw` across all nodes within the same L1 AS **MUST** be capped to **20 %** of the global total.
* **Per-Org cap:** nodes mapped to the same RPKI organisation (or equivalent attestation) **MUST** be capped to **25 %** combined.
* Effective weight: `vote_weight = min(vote_weight_raw, caps)`.

### 10.3 Quorum, Diversity & Partition Safety

A proposal passes when **all** hold:

1. `Σ weight(ACK) ≥ 0.67 × Σ weight(active_nodes_14d)`, where `active_nodes_14d` are nodes seen on HTX within **14 days**.
2. ACKs span **≥ 24** distinct AS groups and **≥ 3** SCION ISDs; no single AS contributes **> 20 %** nor single Org **> 25 %** of ACK weight.
3. ACKs are observed over **≥ 2** disjoint path classes per §4 with consistent reachability (median loss < 2 %).
4. A **partition check** confirms the median path diversity and ACK composition did not degrade by > 20 % in the **7 days** prior to close.

### 10.4 Upgrade Delay

After threshold, activation waits **≥ 30 days**. If §10.3 fails at any time ≥ 7 days before activation, activation **MUST** be deferred until criteria are met for **7** consecutive days.
Raven Development Team publishes a time-lock hash of the final text.

## 11  Compliance Summary

An implementation is **compliant** if it:

1. Implements HTX over TCP-443 **and** QUIC-443 with origin-mirrored TLS + ECH; performs per-connection calibration (§5.1).
2. Uses **negotiated-carrier, replay-bound** access tickets (§5.2) with variable lengths and rate-limits.
3. Performs inner Noise *XK* with key separation, nonce lifecycle, and rekeying (§5.3); uses hybrid X25519-Kyber768 from *2027-01-01*.
4. Emulates HTTP/2/3 with adaptive cadences and origin-mirrored parameters (§5.5).
5. Bridges non-SCION links by **HTX-tunnelled transition**; no on-wire transition header on public networks (§4.2).
6. Offers `/betanet/htx/1.1.0` and `/betanet/htxquic/1.1.0` transports (§6.2).
7. Bootstraps via rotating rendezvous IDs derived from **BeaconSet** with PoW and multi-bucket rate-limits; deterministic seeds not used (§6.3–§6.5).
8. Selects mixnodes using BeaconSet randomness with per-stream entropy and path diversity (§7.2); “balanced” mode enforces **≥ 2** hops until trust ≥ **0.8** (§7.1–§7.3).
9. Verifies alias ledger with **finality-bound 2-of-3** and applies **Emergency Advance** liveness only under §8.2 conditions; validates quorum certificates as specified.
10. Accepts 128-B Cashu vouchers for known keysets with PoW adverts and rate-limits; supports Lightning settlement (§9).
11. Enforces anti-concentration caps, diversity, and partition checks for governance (§10).
12. Implements anti-correlation fallback with cover connections on UDP→TCP retries (§5.6).
13. Builds are reproducible and publish **SLSA 3** provenance artifacts for release binaries.

---

## 12  Interoperability Notes (1.0 Compatibility)

* 1.1 peers **MAY** offer `/betanet/htx/1.0.0` ALPN for legacy interop.
* Legacy on-wire transition headers **MUST NOT** be used on public networks; bridge via HTX tunnels.
* 64-B vouchers **MAY** be issued only to legacy peers; 1.1 receivers **MUST** accept both for the operator-defined deprecation window.

## 13  End of Betanet Specification 1.1
